# Static pages

Just HTML pages with static Web servers.

Every page was responsive.

---

# First backends

HTML generated on the server side

CGI, Perl

---

# Mostly running on your own hardware

BSD, SunOS, Linux, Apache httpd, PHP, Perl

---

# Shared hosting

Putting HTML on a shared server via FTP

PHP gets popular because of the ease of deployment

---

# Colocated servers

Easier to keep running than your own networks

Still your own hardware

We don't care about the network as much

---

# Rented servers

Easier to start than buying your own hardware

Still you fully manage an entire machine

---

# Virtual private servers

Even easier than renting full servers

Very fast deployment and scaling

Still manual work to spin up and provision servers

---

# Provisioning

Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack

---

# Heroku era

Heroku, Netlify, Compose, Mailgun, Cloudinary

Excellent single-purpose services, Unix-style

Arduino of computing

---

# AWS, Azure, GCP

While Heroku and Netlify are like Adafruit Industries

AWS, Azure and GCP are like Digi-Key Electronics

---

# Lambda functions

You only care about the functions

Still a heavy abstraction

Only supported runtime

---

# Docker

Nothing new if you know Solaris

But new idea on Linux

---

# Vagrant

A different kind of abstraction

Mostly for development

---

# Docker Compose

An abstraction over Docker containers

---

# Kubernetes

Container Orchestration

---

# Terraform

Infrastructure as Code

---

# Custom solutions

AWS CloudFormation

Azure Resource Manager

Google Cloud Deployment Manager

---

# Future

WASI, Fastly, Bytecode Alliance

---
